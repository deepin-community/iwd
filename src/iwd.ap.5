.SH NAME
iwd.ap \- Configuration of IWD access points
.SH NAME
.sp
iwd.ap \- Access point provisioning files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
Description of access point provisioning files.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
An access point provisioning file defines the configuration of an IWD access
point. These files live in \fI$STATE_DIRECTORY\fP/ap (/var/lib/iwd/ap by default).
They are read when the \fInet.connman.iwd.AccessPoint.StartProfile(ssid)\fP DBus
method is used.
.SH FILE FORMAT
.sp
See \fIiwd.network\fP for details on the settings file syntax.
.SH SETTINGS
.sp
The settings are split into several categories.  Each category has a group
associated with it and is described in the corresponding table below.
.SS General Settings
.sp
The group \fB[General]\fP contains general AP configuration.
.TS
center;
|l|l|.
_
T{
Channel
T}	T{
Channel number
.sp
Optional channel number for the access point to operate on. If omitted
the channel will be chosen automatically. Channels greater than or equal
to 36 will select the 5GHz band for the AP to operate on.
.sp
Note: Due to regulatory requirements the linux kernel does not allow or
strictly limits 5GHz use in AP mode while in world roaming. These
frequencies become available once the country is set, either via IWD\(aqs
main.conf option \fB[General].Country\fP (see \fBman iwd.config\fP) or
externally (e.g. iw reg set <CC>). If you are having trouble using 5GHz
ensure the country is set, and that the desired frequency/channel is
unrestricted.
T}
_
T{
RekeyTimeout
T}	T{
Timeout for PTK rekeys (seconds)
.sp
The time interval at which the AP starts a rekey for a given station. If
not provided a default value of 0 is used (rekeying is disabled).
T}
_
.TE
.SS Network Authentication Settings
.sp
The group \fB[Security]\fP contains settings for Wi\-Fi security and authentication
configuration.
.TS
center;
|l|l|.
_
T{
Passphrase
T}	T{
8..63 character string
.sp
WPA\-PSK Passphrase to be used with this access point.  At least one of
\fIPassphrase\fP, \fIPreSharedKey\fP must be present.
T}
_
T{
PreSharedKey
T}	T{
64\-character hex\-string
.sp
Processed passphrase for this network in the form of a hex\-encoded
32\-byte pre\-shared key.  Either this or \fIPassphrase\fP must be present.
T}
_
T{
PairwiseCiphers
T}	T{
Comma separated list of pairwise ciphers for the AP supports.
.sp
Values can include: TKIP, CCMP, GCMP, GCMP\-256, CCMP\-256
.sp
The underlying hardware and IWD\(aqs AP implementation must also support the
ciphers listed
T}
_
T{
GroupCipher
T}	T{
Group cipher the AP uses
.sp
A single cipher value the AP can use as the group cipher. Values are the
same as pairwise ciphers and the same restrictions apply (hardware and
IWD implementation must support the cipher)
T}
_
.TE
.SS IPv4 Network Configuration
.sp
The group \fB[IPv4]\fP contains settings for IWD\(aqs built\-in DHCP server.  All
settings are optional.  They\(aqre used if network configuration was enabled as
described in \fBiwd.config(5)\fP\&.  Omitting the \fB[IPv4]\fP group disables
network configuration for this access point so if an all\-defaults DHCP setup
is desired, the group header line must still be present:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# Enable network configuration
[IPv4]

[other groups follow]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TS

|l|l|.
_
T{
Address
T}	T{
Local IP address or a comma\-separated list of prefix\-notation addresses
.sp
Optional local address pool for the access point and the DHCP server.
If a single address is provided this address will be set on the AP
interface and any other DHCP server options will be derived from it
if not overridden by other settings below.
.sp
If a list of addresses and prefix lengths is specified (in the
\fI<IP>/<prefix\-len>\fP format), a single subnet address will be selected
from the available space each time this profile is started.  The subnet
size is based on the \fB[IPv4].Netmask\fP setting.
.sp
If \fIAddress\fP is not provided and no IP address is set on the
interface prior to calling \fIStartProfile\fP the value of the main.conf
\fB[IPv4].APAddressPool\fP setting will be inherited, which in turn
defaults to 192.168.0.0/16.
.sp
For example, if \fB[IPv4].Netmask\fP is set to 255.255.255.0 and this
setting, or the global \fIAPAddressPool\fP fallback, is set to
\fB192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/22\fP, IWD will select one of the 256 subnets
with addresses in the 192.168.<0\-255>.0/24 range or one of the 4 subnets
with addresses in the 10.0.<0\-3>.0/24 range, allowing 270 possible
subnets.  Defining an address pool larger than the desired subnet gives
IWD a chance to avoid conflicts if other interfaces on the system use
dynamically assigned addresses.
T}
_
T{
Gateway
T}	T{
IP Address of gateway
.sp
IP address of the gateway to be advertised by DHCP. This will fall back
to the local IP address if not provided.
T}
_
T{
Netmask
T}	T{
Local netmask of the AP
.sp
Defaults to a 28\-bit netmask if not provided.
T}
_
T{
DNSList
T}	T{
List of DNS servers as a comma\-separated IP address list
.sp
A list of DNS servers which will be advertised by the DHCP server. If
not provided no DNS servers will be sent by the DHCP server.
T}
_
T{
LeaseTime
T}	T{
Time limit for DHCP leases in seconds
.sp
Override the default lease time.
T}
_
T{
IPRange
T}	T{
Range of IPs given as two addresses separated by a comma
.sp
From and to addresses of the range assigned to clients through DHCP.
If not provided the range from local address + 1 to .254 will be used.
T}
_
.TE
.SS Wi\-Fi Simple Configuration
.sp
The group \fB[WSC]\fP fine\-tunes some Wi\-Fi Simple Configuration local parameters
(formerly known as WPS, Wi\-Fi Protected Setup.)
.TS
center;
|l|l|.
_
T{
DeviceName
T}	T{
1..32\-character string
.sp
Optional Device Name string for the AP to advertise as.  Defaults to
the SSID.
T}
_
T{
PrimaryDeviceType
T}	T{
Subcategory string or a 64\-bit integer
.sp
Optional Primary Device Type for the AP to advertise as.  Defaults to
PC computer.  Can be specified as a lower\-case WSC v2.0.5 subcategory
string or a 64\-bit integer encoding, from MSB to LSB: the 16\-bit
category ID, the 24\-bit OUI, the 8\-bit OUI type and the 16\-bit
subcategory ID.
T}
_
T{
AuthorizedMACs
T}	T{
Comma\-separated MAC address list
.sp
Optional list of Authorized MAC addresses for the WSC registrar to
check on association.  Each address is specified in the
colon\-hexadecimal notation.  Defaults to no MAC\-based checks.
